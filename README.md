## Tech

## Description 
A full-stack to-do list app that lets the user input tasks and stores them in a database. The server lets the user add new tasks, update current tasks with a complete status and delete tasks. When tasks are completed, the time of completion is stored in the database and and the dom is updated. Deleting a task includes a warning via a bootstrap modal that confirms the delete request.

# Setup
- Run npm install in the terminal to get all dependencies.
- Run the script in databas.sql to set up the database. 
- Run npm run server to start the server via nodemon.
- Go to http://localhost:5000/ to use the app.
